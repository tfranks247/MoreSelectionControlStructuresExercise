1. Process customer record

A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 
The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:



IF salesTax= "0"

THEN

          Print "tax exempt"

ELSE

          IF salesTax = “1”

          THEN

                  Print "state tax only"

          ELSE

                   IF salesTax = "2"

                   THEN

                             Print "federal and state tax"

                   ELSE

                             IF salesTax = "3"
							 
								Print "special sales tax"

                   ENDIF
				   
	compute sales tax
	compute total amount due
	print customer name
	print purchase amount
	print sales tax
	print total amount due
	

2. Calculate employee's pay

A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, pay rate and the number of hours 
worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field and the hours worked field and, if valid, 
compute the employee’s weekly pay and then print it and the input data.

Read employee number
read pay rate
display number of hours worked in one week
Validate pay rate
Validate hours worked
print data 
input data


Validation

IF hours worked = <60

THEN 
	
	hourly rate = "$25.00 per hour"
	
	ELSE
	
		IF hours worked = "out of range" 
		
		THEN
		
			hourly rate = "not calculable" 
			
			ElSE
			
			IF hours worked = >35 
			
			THEN
			
			hourly rate = hourly rate * 1.5
